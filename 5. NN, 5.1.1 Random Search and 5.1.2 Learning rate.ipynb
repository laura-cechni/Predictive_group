       "# Assuming the preprocessing steps are applied, and data is split into train and test sets.\n",
       "\n",
       "# Define input layers for each feature.\n",

       "#### Model Architecture #2: Advanced Model with Mixed Features\n",
       "For a more advanced model, consider including feature crosses, deeper embedding layers for high-cardinality features, and possibly recurrent architectures for handling sequence data (e.g., the sequence of actors might provide some contextual clue).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Experimental Summary (Hypothetical)\n",
       "Through experimentation, we might find that:\n",
       "- Higher embedding dimensions for directors and genres lead to better performance but increase the risk of overfitting.\n",
       "- Regularization techniques (such as dropout) are crucial to manage overfitting, especially with a complex model.\n",
       "- Normalizing numerical features generally results in better performance.\n",
       "- Model performance might vary significantly with different optimizers and learning rates, where Adam and a learning rate scheduler can be quite effective.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Evaluation and Insights\n",
       "We would use Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as our main metrics to evaluate the model's performance due to the regression nature of the problem. Insights might reveal the importance of certain features over others and indicate potential data quality issues or areas where more data could enhance model accuracy.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Potential Areas for Improvement\n",
       "- Incorporating more sophisticated feature engineering (e.g., polynomial features for numerical data).\n",
       "- Exploration of more complex model architectures or ensemble methods.\n",
       "- Extensive hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize model parameters effectively.\n",
       "\n",

       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the high-level overview and codes snippets, you should be able to implement a TensorFlow Recommenders model that learns from the movie dataset to predict ratings accurately. Remember, iteration over different model architectures and hyperparameters is key to finding the best performing model.\n",

However, since we are directly using a Sequential model inside a class that inherits from `tfrs.models.Model`, you don't actually need a custom `compute_loss` method; instead, you can rely on built-in methods.

    "- In this case, the RMSE value of approximately 0.966 on the test dataset signifies that, on average, the model's predictions deviate from the actual IMDb scores by around 0.966 points.\n",
    "- Interpreting this value in the context of IMDb scores, where ratings typically range from 1 to 10, a RMSE of 0.966 indicates that the model's predictions are reasonably accurate. It implies that the majority of the model's predictions are within approximately 1 point of the actual IMDb scores. Therefore, the lower the RMSE, the higher the accuracy of the model's predictions. In summary, a RMSE of 0.966 suggests that the model is performing well in predicting IMDb scores based on the given features."

    "The model shows promising performance with decreasing training and validation RMSE, indicating effective learning and generalisation. Consistent reduction in loss during training suggests minimized prediction errors. Lack of regularisation loss suggests the model avoids overfitting. The test dataset's RMSE of approximately 0.966 signifies accurate predictions with a reasonable margin of error. Overall, the model demonstrates robust performance in predicting IMDb scores based on the provided features, with most predictions within 1 point of actual scores. This implies that the choosen LLM illustrates a promising potential to design effective NN arhitectures for specified tasks."

    "Task Description:\n",
    "Provide me with the full code that modifies the existing model to adjust the learning rate in the optimizer to 0.05. This change aims to observe the impact of a higher learning rate on the model's training performance and prediction accuracy for movie ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Current Setup:\n",
    "- The model uses TensorFlow and TensorFlow Recommenders libraries.\n",
    "- The current learning rate in the Adam optimizer is set at 0.001.\n",
    "\n",
    "Required Modification:\n",
    "- Provide the full code that increases the learning rate in the Adam optimizer from 0.001 to 0.05. Ensure that your response separates code from explanatory text.\n",

    "Objectives:\n",
    "- Implement the learning rate change with the rest of the code.\n",
    "- Observe and document the effects on model training and accuracy.\n",
    "- Keep the model architecture unchanged.\n",
    "- Ensure that code is separated from text.\n",

    "Task Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide me with the full code that enhances the existing neural network model with a Random Search. This change aims to determine the optimal number of neurons in the first dense layer and optimal learning rate for predicting the IMDB_Score movie ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Current Setup:\n",
    "- The model uses TensorFlow and TensorFlow Recommenders libraries.\n",
    "- The model should import keras_tuner using !pip\n",
    "- The model preprocesses the features by including one hot encoded genres and normalized numeric features to input into the neural network.\n",
    "- There are two parts to the neural network: one concatenates movie features and the other predicts movie ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Required Modification:\n",
    "- Provide the full code that performs hyperparameter tuning using keras_tuner's Random Search. The output should include the optimal number of neurons in the first dense layer and learning rate for the optimizer. Ensure that your response separates code from explanatory text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives:\n",
    "- Perform hyperparameter tuning to explore different configurations of the number of neurons in the first dense layer and the learning rate.\n",
    "- The hyperparameters identified should optimize the accuracy of the model. \n",
    "- Keep the model architecture unchanged.\n",
    "- Ensure that code is separated from text.\n",
    "- Any text output should be commented out using #\n",

    "1. Adjust the following Python code to perform Random Search hyperparameter tuning and document the changes inline. Provide the python code seperately from the explanations. Make sure that the code combines the full model.\n",
